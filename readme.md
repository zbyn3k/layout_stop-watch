# CSS Animated Stopwatch

This project demonstrates creating a functioning, animated stopwatch primarily using CSS animations. The stopwatch, displayed at the center of the page, includes both a minute and second hand, a set of clock indicators and numbers.

## Design
The design is flexible and customizable based on css variable values. Currently, the clock displays with several elements such as hands, indicators, a center dot and numbers, all aligned at absolute positions within the clock circle.

## Implementation
The implementation utilizes SCSS with a BEM naming strategy for the CSS classes. Animation for the hands of the stopwatch was created using `@keyframes` for a smooth motion around the clock face. 

The project's file structure is divided into individual parts for clean and maintainable code, easy to follow for developers. 

Variable mixins, such as `circle($radius)` and `rectangle($length, $width)`, were used to ensure modularity and reusability and reduce repetitive code.

## Features
* Animated second and minute hands with precise timing
* Design flexibility: Easy customization based on SCSS variables
* BEM naming strategy for organized and easy-to-understand CSS
* Use of mixins for code efficiency 

This project is a great example of the power of CSS animations and the kind of interactivity that can be achieved with pure CSS.
